==================
With your GraphQL server built, it's now time to set up GraphQL on the client side. Very broadly, a client is just an application that communicates with a server. Due to the flexibility of GraphQL, there's no prescription for how to build a client.All you really need to send queries and mutations is the ability to send an HTTP request. Once the service responds with some data, you can use it in your client no matter what that client is.
