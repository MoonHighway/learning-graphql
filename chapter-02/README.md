Chapter 2 - Graph Theory
==================
Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are a way to formally represent a collection of interconnected objects. You can think of a graph as an object containing data points and their connections. In computer science, graphs typically describe networks of data.

You don't need to know anything about graph theory to work with GraphQL, but it's fun to learn about the history behind these concepts!
