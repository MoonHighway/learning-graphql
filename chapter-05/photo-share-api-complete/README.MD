PhotoShare API
===========
These are the finished files for the PhotoShare API at the end of chapter 5. To run these files, simply:

1. Run `npm install` on this folder.
2. Replace the values of the `.env` file with your unique variables. 

```
DB_HOST=<YOUR_MONGODB_HOST>
CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET>
```
3. Run `npm start` and open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/playground`.
