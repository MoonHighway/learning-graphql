Chapter 5 - Creating a GraphQL API
==================
We've explored the history. We've written some queries. We've created a schema. Now you're ready to create a fully functioning GraphQL service. In this chapter, we'll use Apollo Server 2.0, an open source solution from Meteor Development Group, to stand up a GraphQL server for the PhotoShare project. Along the way, we'll solidify a schema, write resolvers, incorporate a database, and add GitHub authorization to the project.

In this chapter, we'll build the PhotoShare API. The completed files for this chapter can be found at [photo-share-api](https://github.com/MoonHighway/learning-graphql/tree/master/chapter-05/photo-share-api).
